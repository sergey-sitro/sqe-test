Our whole lives cast so clear on our faces
Every thought, every hope lost to aging

But I will live forever
Or have I been here dead for years?

Our youth passed by, it was fleeting
We tell each other stories, repeating

And I will live forever
Or have i been here dead for years?

A forest of lights
The dawn of time
These photographs
All covered in glass
